why webservice is required ?
===========================

lets say I have spring mvc application and some one asked me can  I resuse your business logic

what is the way I can give this component , I can make a jar of it and give it to the person 

it is not feasible 

what will happen if we change some thing in business logic 

we need to recompile and recreate the jar right 


what is solution :
=================

we need webservices :

W3c consortium definitation : 
-------------------------------------

Software system designed to support the interoperable machine to machine interaction over 
network .

3keys : 

------------
it is desinged for application to application interaction : 

it should be interoperable :


another application cannot talk to my todo appication 

webservices should be interoperable : any apllication of any code can talk to my webservices 
==========


there are multiple applications written on different languages and frameworks  they can also 
communicate to my application if it is webservice 

Communication over the network 
------------------------------  : allows 



How data exchange between application take place : 
----------------------------------------------------

our webservices should be platform independent 

the request and response should be platform independent :

two format  : xml 
another: json : javascript object notation :


Q : how the application A knows format of the request and response  
------------------------------------------------------------------

How does it know what request to send , where to send it and what is the format of the 
response :
Solution : ======  to this is 

the service definition :

Every webservice offers a service definitiom :


=================================================

Service definition will specify a request response format is it json or xml 

it specifies the structure of the request 

also it specifies structure of the response

it also defines the endpoints like where to call the webservice '

Request ans Response : 
----------------------
Message exchange format 

what is service definition 
--------------------------------

service definition is the contract betweeen service provider and service consumer 

other key terminilogy is transport :
------------------------------------

Transport defines how service is called : if  service is exposed over internet ?
two popular format : Http and MQ 
HTTP is over the web : 
MQ protocol : comunnication over a queue :
MQ stands for Message Queue protocol :

this protocol is used for asynchronous messaging between applications 
Software component sends message to queue which is then stored in queue until  it is recieved by recipient
