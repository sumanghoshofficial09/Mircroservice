Rest stnads for representational state transfer
it is developed by roy fielding the guy who devleoped Http protocol , naturally we will take the best of http

how http works
--------------

browser send get request to server and server send server send back response containing html 
browser looks at the response , takes the html and display it on the screen 


filling a form and clicking a submit button :
---------------------------------------------

in those kind of scenario , browser is sending the post request to the server 

Http defines the header present in request and also body of the request 

in addition to request header and body there are http methods 
---------------------------
you can indicate what action by using particular http method 

GET : get

POST : create

PUT : update 
DELETE : delete 

Http response will also include the http status codes : 

200 : successful / ok 

404 :  page not found 

Rest ful webservice is trying to define services that is already present in http 
=================================================================================

most important abstraction in rest is resource : 
----------------------------------------------------

resource is any thing we want to expose to the outside through my application :


lets say for todo application  users are the resources :

a specific todo is a resource 

list of todo is also a resource :

/user/suman
/user/suman/todos
/user/suman/todos/1
